# Figures

This folder contains the figures for the second and third subject that were scanned during 100 runs from the data set provided by Gonzalez-Castillo et al. (2012). The figures of the first subject were shown in Section 3.1 of the paper. 

The same trends as described in Section 3.1 can be found here again, but with one remark. The baseline activity (and/or reaction) of the remaining two subject is lower than that of the subject presented in the paper. The 60th and 75th percentile value of the observed contrast estimates show trends similar to the small practically relevant effect sizes (60th percentile) of the first subject from the paper. The 90th and 95th percentile show trends similar to the medium practically relevant effect sizes (75th percentile) of the subject presented in the paper. To see the trends similar to the large practically relevant effect sizes from the subject presented in the paper, higher percentile values should be used to analyse the data of these two subjects (e.g. 97.5th percentile and 99th percentile).

### MSI_*.pdf

Here, the Maitra similarity index (MSI) is shown for the ABT and mLR method, measuring whole-brain voxelwise overlap between every possible pair of two runs.

### Coherence_*.pdf

Coherene, or voxelwise replication, across the 100 runs is shown for both the ABT and mLR method.

### SDvox_*.pdf

The standard deviation on the number of detected voxels across the 100 runs is shown for the ABT and mLR method. This measure represents voxelwise stability.

### Nvox_*.pdf

The number of detected voxels across the 100 runs is shown to measure the voxelwise variability.

### TDR_*.pdf

The truth detection rate (TDR) is shown for the mLR and ABT method. This measure represents voxelwise sensitivity.
